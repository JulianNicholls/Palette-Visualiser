# Palette Visualiser

Displays the five colours in every combination from an Adobe Palette created
at the site that used to be called [Kuler](color.adobe.com).

Now shows the five colours on Black and White backgrounds and specifically
with Black and White text.

The contrast ratio is now displayed, the calculation is
on the [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#contrast-ratiodef) site.
