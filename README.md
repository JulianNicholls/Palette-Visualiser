# Palette Visualiser

Displays the five colours in every combination from an Adobe palette created
at the site now called [Adobe Color CC](color.adobe.com), previously Kuler.

Now shows the five colours on Black and White backgrounds and
with Black and White text.

The contrast ratio is now displayed, the calculation is
on the [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#contrast-ratiodef) site.
